## Connecting to Devnet

### Introduction
The Casper Condor release is being rolled out in a phased fashion, allowing people to test their code, SDKs and smart contracts, before migrating to MainNet. The first phase of this is rolling out to **DevNet**. This article is a guide to the process for gaining access to DevNet, what to expect when you do access DevNet, and any other concerns. 

### Requesting Access
You can request access to Devnet using the provided form here: [https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe7K6IYZ_PJbutu7a2mQt1rQ3K1TXNkHQS6w7Nsx1LOdcTV2w](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe7K6IYZ_PJbutu7a2mQt1rQ3K1TXNkHQS6w7Nsx1LOdcTV2w/viewform)

Be sure to include a valid Casper public key in this form, which we will fund with CSPR token to allow you to test. 

Once your request hads been processed, you will be notified and provided with a list of IP addresses to connect to DevNet. 

At time of writing (8 July 2024) there is no Block Explorer for Devnet, but we hope to be able to provide one within the next week.
